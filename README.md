* Add Assets  

    Include screenshots in user inputs as needed. Using the relative filepath, add it to your input:  
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```  
    Please make sure that your original project repository (project for which the readme is being made) contains an `assets/images` folder and screenshot file is uploaded to it.  

* Finish  
    
    When all the inputs are given, the application generates a README.md in the folder named 'dist'.  
    Navigate to the 'dist' folder and use it for your project.  
    New README.md files generated will be overwritten on the existing file.  
    Transfer the file to your corresponding project folder before running the app again.
